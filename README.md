# Overview
Pets are our best friends. They are loyal to their owners and offer the best companion, bringing pleasure to our life. However, a lot of pets are abandoned by unresponsible owners, suffering hunger and bitterness. In this project, we analyze pets' data from PetFinder.my to predict the pet adoption speed to help pets at a shelter to find their responsible owners. This project is performed by Yiming Huang, Ruxin Shen, and Kai Kang. The data scientist, Jingyi Yu from Yelp will give industry perspective to improve the quality of this project.
